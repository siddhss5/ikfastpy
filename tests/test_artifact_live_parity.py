"""Artifact <-> live-solver parity (U2, #389).

The codegen emitters re-express solver logic as generated source (the specialised
composers inline the SP1/SP3/SP4 algebra; every emitter re-implements the
verify/dedup/postprocess tail). That is duplication of *behaviour* across two
representations -- the deepest drift risk in the codebase, and the one no
byte-snapshot catches (an artifact can regenerate byte-consistently and still
compute a different IK set than the library it was generated from).

This test pins behavioural parity: for every shipped prebuilt, ``artifact.solve``
and ``Manipulator(kb).solve`` (which dispatches the live solver) must return the
same IK set on the same pose. If the emitted code ever diverges from the live
solver, CI goes red here.

Scoping (each documented at its constant below): ``ikgeo.general_6r`` is compared
FK-only (its cold Raghavan-Roth re-derivation is slightly less accurate than the
baked artifact); ``jointlock.seven_r`` is skipped entirely (cold Husty-Pfurner vs
baked cached-RR is the documented #328 gap, not codegen drift); and near-singular
poses are skipped for strict set-parity by Jacobian condition number.
