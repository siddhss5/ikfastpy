"""T-perturbation rescue (#319) — coverage on Group A reproducers.

Five of the eight outstanding coverage gaps share the same root cause:
``m_quad`` is structurally rank-deficient on a measure-zero ridge in
q-space, the analytical RR path returns 0 sols at the exact ridge, but
genuine analytical solutions exist arbitrarily close. The T-perturbation
rescue (see :mod:`ssik.refinement.rescue`) recovers them by perturbing
the target, re-solving, and LM-refining each candidate back to the
original ``T_target``.

These tests pin coverage on the falsifying examples that landed #298,
#304, and #280 — at three levels: the analytical path still returns 0
there (baseline), the standalone rescue recovers them, and bulletproof
``solve()`` (allow_rescue=True, the default) recovers them with no
explicit opt-in. If any layer regresses, this file fires.

#309 OpenArm right is exercised via the uniform-fuzz sweep rather than
here; #286 PiPER's stored q* no longer reproduces (the sweep moved on).
