"""Boundary-behaviour parity for three_parallel across both backends (#499).

Two things the reachable-pose family sweep (``test_three_parallel_family``)
doesn't touch, both run against ``{python, cpp}``:

1. **In-solve Newton rescue.** Random reachable poses close analytically, so
   ``allow_refinement=True`` is a no-op there. At a genuinely near-singular pose
   the closed form emits a candidate that FK-misses just past the 1e-7 gate; the
   forced-refinement path (what the shipped artifact uses) Newton-polishes it and
   keeps it if it now closes. We pin such a pose and assert the *robust*
   invariants of that wired path:

   - **Soundness**: every refined solution FK-closes within the arm's ceiling.
   - **Monotonic + additive**: refinement never drops a solution the analytical
     pass already found; it only adds rescued ones (norefine set is a subset of
     the refine set).

   We deliberately do NOT assert q-space parity of the *rescued* solution across
   backends: at a near-singular pose that solution is genuinely non-unique (it
   FK-closes at ~8e-8 with a q that differs by BLAS backend -- the same
   representative ambiguity documented in ``test_three_parallel`` #56). Nor do we
   assert the rescue strictly fires on every platform (whether the candidate
   lands just inside or just outside the 1e-7 gate is backend-dependent). The
   pinned pose fires on the reference; the assertions hold on any platform.

2. **Unreachable targets.** A pose outside the workspace must return the empty
   set with ``is_ls=True`` -- identically on both backends.
