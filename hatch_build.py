"""Custom hatchling build hook: cythonize the modules that ship Cython
pure-Python-mode annotations (``@cython.ccall``, ``@cython.locals(...)``)
and force-include the resulting ``.so`` files in the wheel.

The annotated source modules stay valid pure-Python so the library
still imports without compiled extensions (sdist install on an
unsupported platform, dev checkouts that haven't run ``build_ext``);
the decorators are no-ops at the Python level. Compiled wheels load the
``.so`` shim ahead of the ``.py`` source.

Compiled targets (#248): the hot leaf primitives that dominate FK and
LM-polish budgets. Add new files here as their Cython annotations land.
